## energyControl Project
### Energy management with PV, energy storage system, wallbox, heatpump and more
Control and plan electric energy distribution to heatpump and wallbox 
based on 
- current and next-day hourly electricty prices (tibber), 
- current PV production, 
- energy storage load state (e3dc),
- expected PV production based on
  - hourly weather forecast (dwd, German weather service) 
  - and calculated solar altitude,
- and expected heat pump power consumption based on weather forecast.
### Development status
