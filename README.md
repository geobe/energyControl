## energy management with PV, energy storage system, wallbox, heatpump and more
Control and plan electric energy distribution to heatpump and wallbox 
based on current and next-day hourly electricty prices (tibber), 
current PV production, 
energy storage load state (e3dc),
expected PV production based on weather forecast (dwd, German weather service) and solar altitude,
and expected heat pump power consumption based on weather forecast.
